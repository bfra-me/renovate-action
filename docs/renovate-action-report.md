## 3. GitHub Action Technologies

### Action Structure

- **Composite Action**: The action is defined as a composite action in `action.yaml`, which combines multiple steps into a single action.
  - Features used:
    - Inputs and outputs definition
    - Environment variables
    - Conditional execution
    - Step references
    - **Orchestration of Renovate Execution**: The composite action does not run Renovate directly. Instead, it prepares the environment (fetching a GitHub App token, configuring environment variables, managing cache) and then delegates the actual Renovate run to the official [`renovatebot/github-action`](https://github.com/renovatebot/github-action) by invoking it as a step. This ensures that Renovate is executed in a well-supported, up-to-date, and isolated environment, leveraging the official Docker image and best practices for GitHub Actions.
    - The composite action passes all necessary configuration, authentication, and environment details to the `renovatebot/github-action` step, ensuring seamless integration and execution.

- **GitHub Actions API**: The action uses the GitHub Actions toolkit for Node.js.
  - Package: `@actions/core` (v1.11.1)
  - Usage: Core functionality for inputs, outputs, logging, and errors

### Docker Integration

- **Docker**: The action uses Docker to run Renovate in a container.
  - Image: `ghcr.io/renovatebot/renovate`
  - Configuration: `docker/entrypoint.sh`, `action.yaml`
  - Features used:
    - Custom entrypoint script
    - Environment variable passing
    - Volume mounting for cache persistence

- **Docker Entrypoint Script**: The `docker/entrypoint.sh` script initializes the Docker container with the necessary tools:
  - **Tool Installation**: Installs and configures essential tools with specific versions:
    - YQ (YAML processor): v4.45.1 - Used for parsing and modifying YAML files
    - Node.js: v22.11.0 - Runtime environment for Renovate
    - PNPM: v10.9.0 - Package manager
    - Yarn: v4.9.1 - Package manager (alternative to NPM)
  - **Version Pinning**: All tool versions are explicitly pinned with Renovate-compatible annotations (`# renovate: datasource=...`) to ensure they can be automatically updated
  - **Runtime Setup**: Creates the `/tmp/renovate` directory for runtime files and adjusts permissions
  - **Execution**: Runs Renovate as the non-root `ubuntu` user for security best practices
  - **Environment Preparation**: Ensures all necessary tools are available for dependency management across different ecosystems

- **Renovate Configuration and Execution**: The action provides extensive configuration options that are passed to the Renovate bot:
  - **Repository Discovery**:
    - `autodiscover`: Controls whether to automatically find repositories to process
    - `autodiscover-filter`: JSON array for filtering which repositories to include
    - `branch`: Optional specific branch targeting for Renovate operations

  - **Execution Control**:
    - `dry-run`: When enabled, logs actions without making actual changes
    - `print-config`: Outputs fully-resolved configuration when enabled
    - `log-level`: Controls verbosity of logging (default: "info")

  - **Caching System**:
    - `cache`: Optional cache enabling for improved performance
    - Cache versioning based on Renovate major version
    - Cross-run persistence with GitHub Actions cache
    - Managed with `actions/cache/restore` and `actions/cache/save`

  - **Authentication Flow**:
    - Uses GitHub App authentication via `actions/create-github-app-token`
    - Configures Git author identity based on GitHub App
    - Ignores commits from specific authors to prevent loops

  - **Global Configuration**:
    - Predefined onboarding configuration using organization presets
    - Custom dependency dashboard footer with manual trigger option
    - Preconfigured list of allowed shell commands
    - Standardized onboarding PR structure and naming

  - **Execution Flow**:
    1. Authenticates via GitHub App credentials
    2. Generates configuration outputs for subsequent steps
    3. Manages caching (restore/prepare/save)
    4. Executes Renovate via the official Docker container
    5. Applies comprehensive environment configuration
    6. Reports Docker image and version information as outputs

- **Renovate**: The core technology that powers the dependency updates.
  - Version: 39.257.8 (specified in action.yaml)
  - Usage: Runs inside Docker container via the `renovatebot/github-action` step
  - Features used:
    - GitHub App authentication
    - Repository autodiscovery
    - Dependency update management

### Renovate Configuration Presets and Self-Updates

The Renovate configuration for this repository (`.github/renovate.json5`) leverages external presets and defines specific rules for how Renovate manages its own dependencies.

- **External Presets**:
  - The configuration extends presets from the [`bfra-me/renovate-config`](https://github.com/bfra-me/renovate-config) repository (specifically `bfra-me/renovate-config#v3` and `bfra-me/renovate-config:internal.json5#v3`). These shared presets likely define common organizational settings like automerge strategies, labels, schedules, and base package rules.
  - It also uses `security:openssf-scorecard` and `github>sanity-io/renovate-config:semantic-commit-type`.

- **Managing Renovate Updates**: The `.github/renovate.json5` file includes specific `packageRules` to control updates for Renovate-related components:
  - **Matching Packages**: Rules target `ghcr.io/renovatebot/renovate` (the Docker image used in `action.yaml`), `renovatebot/github-action` (the action used as a step in `action.yaml`), and potentially `renovatebot/renovate` / `renovate` (for documentation or other references).
  - **Semantic Commit Types**: Updates to these packages are automatically assigned semantic commit prefixes (`feat!`, `feat`, `fix`) based on the update type (major, minor, patch). This aligns Renovate's own updates with the conventional commit strategy used for releases.
  - **Grouping Major Updates**: All _major_ version updates for these Renovate components are grouped into a single PR named "Renovate". This simplifies the management of potentially breaking changes introduced by major Renovate upgrades.
  - **Scheduling**: Renovate updates are scheduled for specific off-peak times (weekends and evenings/early mornings on weekdays) to minimize disruption.
  - **Affected Files**:
    - `action.yaml`: The versions for both the `renovatebot/github-action` (in the `uses:` clause) and the `ghcr.io/renovatebot/renovate` Docker image (in the `env.RENOVATE_VERSION` comment) are directly updated by these rules.
    - `README.md`: A custom regex manager updates links pointing to specific Renovate release tags.

This configuration ensures that the action itself stays up-to-date with the latest Renovate versions while adhering to the project's commit conventions and release strategy, grouping significant updates for easier review.

### Embedded Configuration in `action.yaml`

Beyond the repository-specific `.github/renovate.json5`, the composite action (`action.yaml`) itself embeds significant configuration, passing it to the `renovatebot/github-action` step via environment variables (`RENOVATE_*`). This provides opinionated defaults and enforces certain behaviors for users of `bfra-me/renovate-action`.

- **Intent**: The primary goals of this embedded configuration are:
  - **Standardization**: Enforce GitHub App authentication and a standard onboarding experience using `bfra-me/renovate-config` presets.
  - **Security**: Limit allowed shell commands (`allowedCommands`) for post-upgrade tasks and ignore commits from known bot authors (`gitIgnoredAuthors`) to prevent infinite loops.
  - **User Experience**: Provide a custom footer in the Dependency Dashboard (`dependencyDashboardFooter`) with a manual trigger option.
  - **Abstraction**: Simplify usage by handling the setup of Git author details, platform settings, and other parameters automatically based on the GitHub App context.

- **Key Hardcoded Settings**:
  - `RENOVATE_CONFIG`: Injects a JSON blob containing `allowedCommands`, `onboardingConfig`, `onboardingConfigFileName`, `onboardingPrTitle`, etc.
  - `RENOVATE_GIT_IGNORED_AUTHORS`: A static list of author emails/patterns.
  - `RENOVATE_DEPENDENCY_DASHBOARD_FOOTER`: A specific markdown string.
  - `docker-cmd-file`, `docker-user`, `mount-docker-socket`: Specific settings for how `renovatebot/github-action` executes Docker.

- **Potential Improvements for Flexibility**: While these defaults provide a consistent experience, they limit customization. Future enhancements could involve adding new inputs to `action.yaml` to allow users to override:
  - The entire `RENOVATE_CONFIG` JSON blob (e.g., `global-config-json` input).
  - Specific onboarding settings (e.g., `onboarding-preset`, `onboarding-pr-title`).
  - The list of `allowedCommands`.
  - The list of `gitIgnoredAuthors`.
  - The `dependencyDashboardFooter` string.

Exposing these via inputs would make the `bfra-me/renovate-action` more adaptable to diverse user requirements without necessitating forks.

## 4. CI/CD Technologies

### GitHub Workflows

- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment.
  - Workflows defined in `.github/workflows/`
  - Key workflows:
    - `main.yaml`: Primary CI/CD pipeline
    - `renovate.yaml`: Runs Renovate on the repository itself
    - `scorecard.yaml`: Security scoring
    - `codeql-analysis.yaml`: Code security scanning

- **Renovate Workflow (`renovate.yaml`)**: This workflow is specifically designed to run Renovate on the `renovate-action` repository itself, enabling automated self-updates.
  - **Purpose**: To keep the action's own dependencies (Node packages, base actions like `renovatebot/github-action`, Renovate Docker image version) up-to-date.
  - **Triggers**: Runs on various events including:
    - `push` to any branch (with path filtering to run only if relevant files like `action.yaml` or `.github/renovate.json5` change).
    - `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs (accepts `log-level` and `print-config` inputs).
    - `workflow_run` after the `main.yaml` workflow completes successfully on the `main` branch.
    - `issues`/`pull_request` `edited` events, specifically checking for checkbox interactions (`- [x] <!-- ... -->`) on `renovate/` branches to trigger actions via the Dependency Dashboard or PR comments.
  - **Execution**: Uses the local composite action (`uses: ./`) to run Renovate, passing necessary inputs like authentication secrets, caching flags, and branch context. It runs in `dry-run` mode for pushes to non-default branches.
  - **Concurrency Control**: Ensures only one instance runs per context, cancelling older runs.

- **Main Workflow (`main.yaml`)**: Serves as the primary CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Purpose**: Validates code changes, builds distributable code, runs tests, and handles releases.
  - **Triggers**: Runs on `pull_request` to `main`, `push` to `main`, `merge_group`, and `workflow_dispatch`.
  - **Job Dependencies**: `setup` -> (`check`, `build`, `test`) -> `release`.
  - **Key Jobs & Steps**:
    - `setup`: Installs dependencies (`--frozen-lockfile`), uses `dorny/paths-filter` based on `.github/filters.yaml` to determine changed paths, outputs results (`src-changed`, `dist-changed`, etc.).
    - `check`: Runs linters/formatters (`pnpm check`) if relevant files changed.
    - `build`: Builds `dist/` (`pnpm build`) if source files changed or on push to `main`. Critically, it verifies that the built `dist/` matches the committed version using `git diff`.
    - `test`: Runs unit tests (`pnpm test`) if source files changed or on push to `main`. Includes a conditional self-test (`uses: ./`) of the action, primarily on PRs.
    - `release`: Runs on `push` to `main` after other jobs succeed. Uses `semantic-release` (with GitHub App credentials) to determine the next version, create Git tags, generate changelogs, create GitHub releases, and update the major version tag (e.g., `v5`). Merges `main` into the `release` branch before running semantic-release.
  - **Execution Flow Differences**:
    - **On Pull Request**: Runs `setup`, `check` (conditional), `build` (conditional), `test` (conditional, includes self-test). The `release` job runs in dry-run mode, verifying the release process without publishing.
    - **On Push to `main`**: Runs `setup`, `check` (conditional), `build`, `test` (skips self-test). The `release` job runs in full mode, performing the actual release and tag updates.

- **Testing the Composite Action**: The `main.yaml` workflow not only builds and tests the code, but also performs a self-test of the composite action:
  - After building and running unit tests, the workflow invokes the composite action itself (using the local codebase) in a real workflow step, passing in the required secrets and running Renovate in dry-run mode. This ensures that the action is exercised in a real-world context, verifying that it can correctly orchestrate Renovate via the `renovatebot/github-action` and handle all configuration, authentication, and environment setup as expected.
  - This self-test step is crucial for validating the end-to-end functionality of the composite action, beyond just unit and integration tests.

- **GitHub App Authentication**: Used for authenticating with GitHub.
  - Action: `actions/create-github-app-token`
  - Usage: Generates authentication tokens for Renovate

### Release Management

- **Semantic Release**: Automated version management and package publishing.
  - Version: 24.2.3
  - Configuration: `.releaserc.yaml`
  - Features used:
    - Automated versioning based on conventional commits
    - Changelog generation
    - Git tag management
    - GitHub release creation

- **Conventional Commits**: Used for standardized commit messages to automate versioning.
  - Format: `<type>[(scope)]: <description>`
  - Types used: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci
  - Special significance: feat (minor), fix (patch), feat! (major)

## 6. The renovatebot/github-action Technology

### Purpose and Overview

The [renovatebot/github-action](https://github.com/renovatebot/github-action) is a foundational GitHub Action that provides the core functionality for running Renovate in a self-hosted configuration. While our composite action (`bfra-me/renovate-action`) acts as a higher-level orchestrator that simplifies configuration and adds GitHub App authentication, the `renovatebot/github-action` is the actual engine that executes Renovate within a Docker container.

Key purposes of the `renovatebot/github-action`:

- Provides a standardized, containerized environment for running Renovate
- Handles Docker container management and execution
- Exposes configuration options for customizing Renovate runs
- Enables self-hosted Renovate execution within GitHub Actions workflows

### Place in the Renovate Ecosystem

The `renovatebot/github-action` sits at a critical junction in the Renovate ecosystem:

1. **Containerization Layer**: Acts as the bridge between the Renovate core software and containerized execution environments
   - Packages Renovate in Docker images for consistent, isolated execution
   - Manages versioning through Docker tags (e.g., `ghcr.io/renovatebot/renovate:39.259.0`)
   - Provides stable execution environments across different CI systems

2. **Self-Hosting Option**: One of several deployment options for Renovate:
   - **Mend-hosted Renovate App**: Fully managed service requiring minimal setup
   - **Self-hosted with GitHub Actions** (using `renovatebot/github-action`): More customizable with access to private repositories
   - **Self-hosted on other CI platforms**: Maximum flexibility but more complex setup

3. **CI/CD Integration Point**: Enables Renovate to run on schedule or on-demand
   - Supports GitHub Actions native scheduling via `cron` expressions
   - Can be triggered manually through workflow dispatch
   - Integrates with GitHub's cache and artifact systems

### Architecture and Components

The `renovatebot/github-action` is built with a layered architecture:

1. **GitHub Action Interface Layer**:
   - Defined in [action.yml](https://github.com/renovatebot/github-action/blob/main/action.yml)
   - Exposes inputs for configuration options
   - Handles environment variable passing

2. **Docker Execution Layer**:
   - Pulls and executes the Renovate Docker image
   - Manages volume mounts for caching and persistence
   - Handles Docker networking and permissions

3. **Environment Configuration Layer**:
   - Processes and validates Renovate configuration
   - Manages environment variables for the Renovate process
   - Handles authentication with GitHub/GitLab/etc.

### Interaction with Our Composite Action

Our composite action (`action.yaml`) utilizes `renovatebot/github-action` in the following way:

```yaml
- name: Renovate ${{ steps.configure.outputs.renovate-version }}
  uses: renovatebot/github-action@fdbe2b88946ea8b6fb5785a5267b46677d13a4d2 # v41.0.21
  env:
    FORCE_COLOR: '3'
    LOG_LEVEL: ${{ steps.configure.outputs.log-level }}
    RENOVATE_AUTODISCOVER: 'true'
    # Additional environment variables...
  with:
    env-regex: '^(?:CI|FORCE_COLOR|GITHUB_(?:(?!PATH|ENV).)+|(?:HTTPS?|NO)_PROXY|(?:https?|no)_proxy|LOG_LEVEL|NODE_OPTIONS|RENOVATE_\w+|RUNNER_\w+)$'
    docker-cmd-file: '${{ github.action_path }}/docker/entrypoint.sh'
    docker-user: root
    mount-docker-socket: true
    renovate-version: ${{ steps.configure.outputs.renovate-version }}
    token: ${{ steps.get-renovate-app.outputs.token }}
```

Key integration points:

1. **Version Pinning**: We pin to a specific commit hash with a version comment for security and stability
2. **Environment Configuration**: We pass numerous environment variables with `RENOVATE_` prefix for configuration
3. **Custom Entrypoint**: We provide our own entrypoint script for additional setup
4. **Token Passing**: We pass the GitHub App token generated in previous steps

### Key Features and Capabilities

The `renovatebot/github-action` provides several important capabilities:

1. **Docker Image Selection**:
   - `renovate-image`: Allows specifying a custom Docker image (default: `ghcr.io/renovatebot/renovate`)
   - `renovate-version`: Allows specifying a specific Renovate version tag

2. **Docker Configuration**:
   - `docker-cmd-file`: Custom entrypoint script
   - `docker-user`: User to run Renovate as
   - `docker-volumes`: Custom volume mounts
   - `mount-docker-socket`: Mount Docker socket for containerization features

3. **Authentication**:
   - `token`: GitHub token for authentication
   - Support for environment variable-based secrets

4. **Configuration**:
   - `configurationFile`: Path to Renovate configuration
   - `env-regex`: Regex for allowed environment variables

### Enhanced Capabilities in Our Implementation

Our composite action builds upon `renovatebot/github-action` by adding:

1. **GitHub App Authentication**: Instead of Personal Access Tokens, we use GitHub Apps for better security and permissions management
2. **Caching System**: Comprehensive caching with version-based keys
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Pre-configured options that reduce boilerplate
4. **Global Configuration**: Standardized configuration across repositories
5. **Autodiscovery Options**: Enhanced options for repository discovery and filtering

## 7. Renovate Core (`renovatebot/renovate`) Analysis

The underlying engine powering both the `renovatebot/github-action` and, by extension, our `bfra-me/renovate-action` is the [Renovate CLI](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) itself. Understanding its core technology and architecture provides deeper insight into the automation process.

### Key Benefits of Self-Hosted Renovate

Running Renovate in a self-hosted manner (as facilitated by actions like ours) offers several advantages over relying solely on the public Mend Renovate App:

1.  **Access to Private Resources**: Self-hosted runners can access private package registries, internal code repositories, and other resources behind firewalls, which is often necessary for enterprise environments.
2.  **Enhanced Control and Customization**: Provides complete control over the execution environment, Renovate version, configuration presets, and scheduling, allowing for fine-tuned automation workflows tailored to specific organizational needs.
3.  **Security and Compliance**: Keeps sensitive credentials (like private registry tokens) within the user's controlled environment, potentially simplifying security reviews and compliance requirements compared to granting a third-party app access.

### Core Technologies (`renovatebot/renovate`)

Based on the [repository information](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), the core Renovate tool is primarily built using:

- **TypeScript**: The dominant language (approx. 95%), providing type safety and modern JavaScript features for the complex logic involved in dependency analysis and updates across numerous ecosystems.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for the TypeScript codebase.
- **Supporting Languages**: Includes Go, HCL, and others, likely used for specific modules or utilities related to certain package managers or ecosystems (e.g., Go modules, Terraform).

### CLI Entrypoints and Structure (`lib/`)

While we cannot directly inspect the `lib/` directory contents of the external `renovatebot/renovate` repository without cloning it, we can infer its structure and entry points based on its nature as a complex CLI tool built with TypeScript:

- **Likely Entrypoint**: A primary script, often configured via the `bin` field in `package.json`, serves as the main entry point when `renovate` (or `npx renovate`) is executed. This script likely resides within `lib/` (or its compiled counterpart in `dist/`).
- **Core Modules**: The `lib/` directory likely contains the core logic broken down into modules responsible for:
  - Platform integration (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
  - Package manager specifics (npm, pnpm, Maven, Docker, Go modules, etc.)
  - Configuration parsing and resolution
  - Dependency extraction and version checking
  - Update strategies and PR/MR creation
  - Caching mechanisms
  - Worker processes for parallel execution

### Using Renovate as a Library (Direct Imports)

The Renovate package is published to npm primarily for CLI usage (`npx renovate`). While technically possible to import parts of its compiled code (as shown in the example `import {validatePresets} from 'renovate/dist/workers/global'`), this approach has significant drawbacks:

- **Undocumented API**: Renovate does not expose or document a stable public API for library usage. Imports rely on internal module structures and compiled output (`dist/`), which can change between _any_ version (even patches) without warning, breaking the integration.
- **High Fragility**: Relying on internal structures makes the integration extremely brittle and difficult to maintain.
- **Complexity**: Replicating the setup, configuration loading, platform integration, and execution flow handled by the CLI or the official `renovatebot/github-action` would be highly complex.

### Comparison: CLI Execution vs. Library Import

| Feature | CLI Execution (`npx renovate` / `renovatebot/github-action`) | Library Import (`import ... from 'renovate/dist/...'`) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Stability** | High (documented CLI flags and config options) | Very Low (undocumented, internal API) |
| **Support** | Officially supported and documented | Unsupported |
| **Maintainability** | High (stable interface) | Very Low (prone to breakage on Renovate updates) |
| **Integration** | Process-level (via environment variables, config files) | Code-level (direct function calls, object passing) |
| **Complexity** | Lower (leverages existing execution wrappers) | Higher (requires replicating CLI setup logic) |
| **Flexibility** | High (through extensive configuration options) | Potentially higher (direct access to internals) |

### Relevance to `bfra-me/renovate-action`

Considering these approaches as potential alternatives for our `bfra-me/renovate-action`:

1.  **Replacing `renovatebot/github-action` with Direct CLI Call**:
    - _Feasibility_: Possible. Our action could install `renovate` using `pnpm` (already available in our `entrypoint.sh`) and execute `npx renovate` directly within a step.
    - _Pros_: Removes dependency on `renovatebot/github-action`, potentially offering slightly more control over the immediate execution environment.
    - _Cons_: We would need to replicate the environment setup, Docker integration nuances, and potentially some input handling currently managed by `renovatebot/github-action`. This increases the maintenance burden of our action. The official action benefits from direct maintenance by the Renovate team.

2.  **Replacing `renovatebot/github-action` with Library Imports**:
    - _Feasibility_: Technically possible but highly discouraged.
    - _Pros_: Theoretically offers the tightest integration.
    - _Cons_: Extremely fragile due to reliance on undocumented internal APIs. Would likely break frequently with Renovate updates, making our action unreliable. Significant development effort required to replicate the complex orchestration logic.

**Conclusion on Alternatives**: While technically feasible to call the Renovate CLI directly, the current approach of using the official, well-maintained `renovatebot/github-action` provides the best balance of stability, features, and maintainability. It leverages the expertise of the Renovate team in managing the execution environment. Using Renovate as a library is not a viable or recommended strategy due to the lack of a stable public API.
