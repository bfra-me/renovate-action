## Getting Started

The Renovate Action Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your Renovate action performance. Choose from the following analytics views:

- **[Cache Performance](/dashboards/cache/)** - Analyze cache hit rates, sizes, and migration data
- **[Docker Operations](/dashboards/docker/)** - Monitor container performance and tool installations
- **[API Usage](/dashboards/api/)** - Track GitHub API usage and rate limiting
- **[Failure Analysis](/dashboards/failures/)** - Categorized error tracking and troubleshooting
- **[Multi-Repository Overview](/dashboards/overview/)** - Aggregated cross-repository analytics

## Data Collection

Analytics data is collected automatically when the Renovate action runs with analytics enabled. The system captures:

- Cache operation metrics (restore, save, hit rates, sizes)
- Docker performance data (image pulls, tool installations, execution timing)
- GitHub API usage patterns (rate limits, authentication, response times)
- Failure scenarios with categorized error tracking
- Repository metadata and workflow context

All data is sanitized to prevent secrets leakage and stored using GitHub Actions Cache infrastructure.

## Dashboard Architecture

Built with modern web technologies:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** with **[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)** for documentation framework
- **[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)** for interactive visualizations
- **GitHub Actions Cache API** for data storage and retrieval
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop and mobile viewing
- **Dark mode support** with automatic theme detection
