# Cache Performance Dashboard

Monitor and analyze cache performance across your Renovate actions. This dashboard provides insights into cache hit rates, operation timings, and storage trends to help optimize your workflows.

## Overview

The cache system is a critical component for Renovate action performance. Effective caching can reduce execution time significantly by avoiding redundant downloads and computations.

### Key Metrics

- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of cache lookups that result in cache hits
- **Operation Timing**: Average time for restore, save, prepare, and finalize operations
- **Storage Trends**: Cache size growth and cleanup patterns over time
- **Version Migration**: Performance impact of cache key versioning

## Performance Analysis

### Cache Hit Rate Optimization

A healthy cache hit rate typically ranges from 60-90%, depending on your repository's update frequency and cache configuration.

**Factors affecting hit rate:**
- Repository activity level
- Cache key versioning strategy
- Cache TTL settings
- Dependency update patterns

### Operation Timing Insights

Cache operations should complete within these typical ranges:
- **Restore**: 1-5 seconds (network dependent)
- **Save**: 2-10 seconds (size dependent)
- **Prepare**: < 1 second (local operations)
- **Finalize**: < 1 second (cleanup operations)

### Storage Management

Monitor cache size trends to ensure efficient storage usage:
- Large caches (>1GB) may indicate accumulation of stale data
- Rapid size fluctuations suggest frequent cache invalidation
- Steady growth patterns are normal for active repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Low Hit Rates

If cache hit rates are consistently below 50%:

1. **Check cache key stability** - Frequent key changes invalidate caches
2. **Review TTL settings** - Too short TTL causes premature expiration
3. **Analyze dependency patterns** - Frequent updates reduce cache effectiveness

### Slow Operations

For operations taking longer than expected:

1. **Network latency** - Consider repository location and CDN usage
2. **Cache size** - Large caches take longer to restore/save
3. **Storage backend** - GitHub Actions cache performance varies by region

### Storage Issues

For storage-related problems:

1. **Monitor size limits** - GitHub Actions has 10GB per repository limit
2. **Implement retention policies** - Regular cleanup prevents storage bloat
3. **Optimize cache content** - Exclude unnecessary files from caching

## Best Practices

### Cache Key Strategy

- Use semantic versioning for cache keys
- Include relevant context (Node.js version, dependencies hash)
- Avoid including dynamic values (timestamps, run IDs)

### Size Optimization

- Exclude temporary files and logs
- Compress cache content when possible
- Implement incremental caching for large workspaces

### Monitoring

- Set up alerts for hit rate degradation
- Monitor operation timing trends
- Track storage usage against limits
