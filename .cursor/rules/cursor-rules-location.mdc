      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., my-rule-name.mdc)
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules (or its subdirectories)
         - In any other location

      5. File Creation Best Practices:
         - Due to potential issues with direct file creation, use the following printf approach:
           ```bash
           printf '%s\n' '---' 'description: Your description' 'globs: ["your/globs/**/*.{ext}"]' '---' '# Your Rule Title' '' '<rule>' 'name: your_rule_name' '...' '</rule>' > .cursor/rules/your-rule.mdc
           ```
         - This ensures proper YAML frontmatter and content formatting
         - Avoid using echo with heredoc as it may cause formatting issues
         - Always verify the file content after creation using `cat`

      6. Format the globs section correctly:
         - Use unquoted glob patterns: `globs: *.py` ✓
         - Do NOT use quoted glob patterns: `globs: "*.py"` ✗
         - Multiple patterns should be comma-separated: `globs: *.py, *.md, *.txt`

      7. Configure rule application mode correctly:
         - Include the `alwaysApply` field in the frontmatter
         - Set appropriate values based on rule type:
           ```
           ---
           description: Your rule description
           globs: *.py, *.md
           alwaysApply: false
           ---
           ```

      8. Follow these requirements based on rule type:
         - **Always** mode:
           - Set `alwaysApply: true`
           - `globs` can be empty
           - `description` can be blank

         - **Auto Attached** mode:
           - Set `alwaysApply: false`
           - `globs` must contain valid patterns
           - `description` should be populated

         - **Agent Requested** mode:
           - No special frontmatter requirements
           - `description` must be populated for discoverability

         - **Manual** mode:
           - Rule must be manually included in the chat window
           - No special frontmatter requirements

## File Creation Troubleshooting

When creating rule files, you may encounter several common issues. Here are the workarounds:

1. **Two-Step Creation Process**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Create file with basic structure
   printf '%s\n' '---' 'name: rule_name' 'description: Rule description' 'version: 1.0.0' 'author: Author Name' "date: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" 'globs:' '  - "glob/pattern/**/*.ext"' 'tags:' '  - tag1' '  - tag2' '---' > .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc

   # Step 2: Append rule content
   cat << 'EOF' >> .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc

   # Rule Title

   <rule>
   name: rule_name
   description: Detailed description
   filters:
     - type: file_extension
       pattern: "pattern"
   actions:
     - type: suggest
       message: |
         Your message here
   </rule>
   EOF
   ```

2. **Temporary File Method**
   ```bash
   # Create content in temporary file
   TMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
   cat > "$TMP_FILE" << 'EOF'
   ---
   name: rule_name
   description: Rule description
   version: 1.0.0
   author: Author Name
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   globs:
     - "glob/pattern/**/*.ext"
   tags:
     - tag1
     - tag2
   ---

   # Rule Title

   <rule>
   ...
   </rule>
   EOF

   # Move to final location
   mv "$TMP_FILE" .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc
   ```

3. **Content Verification**
   ```bash
   # After creating file, always verify:
   cat .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc

   # Check YAML frontmatter
   head -n 10 .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc

   # Verify rule tags
   grep -A 1 -B 1 '<rule>' .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc
   grep -A 1 -B 1 '</rule>' .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc
   ```

4. **Common Issues and Solutions**

   a. **YAML Frontmatter Issues**
      - Always include empty lines after `---`
      - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
      - Verify no trailing spaces
      ```yaml
      ---
      name: rule_name
      description: Description
      ---

      # Content starts here
      ```

   b. **Rule Tag Issues**
      - Ensure proper spacing around tags
      - Keep tags on their own lines
      ```
      <rule>
      name: rule_name
      ...
      </rule>
      ```

   c. **Content Formatting**
      - Use `|` for multiline strings in YAML
      - Preserve indentation in code blocks
      - Use consistent line endings

5. **Recovery Steps**
   If a file becomes corrupted:
   ```bash
   # Backup existing file
   cp .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc.bak

   # Create new file with correct structure
   printf '%s\n' '---' 'name: rule_name' ... > .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc

   # Copy content from backup, fixing formatting
   sed -n '/^# Rule/,$p' .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc.bak >> .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc
   ```

Remember:
- Always create files in `.cursor/rules/`
- Use consistent formatting
- Verify file content after creation
- Keep backups of important rules
- Test rule files before committing
